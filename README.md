# Predicting Car Prices Using k-Nearest Neighbors
In this project, we'll use the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The dataset we'll be working with contains information on various cars. For each car, we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. More details about the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile).

### Summary of Results
We achieved the lowest RMSE of 2600.43 using a k value of 2 and the 4 best features from the dataset, namely the engine size, horsepower, curb weight, and highway mpg.
